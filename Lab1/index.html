        Answers to additional questions for Lab 1 assignment.

        1- open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of same browser. 
        Would the reader.html have access to the content stored in the local storage by the writer.html?

        Yes. This is because both tabs are in the same browser, and both tabs have access to the same local storage service
        provided by the same browser. As long as both tabs are connected to the same origin (origin + protocol).

        2- open the writer.html and reader.html in two different tabs of two different browsers 
        ( e.g. one in chrome, one in Firefox) . Would the reader.html have access to the content stored 
        in the local storage by the writer.html?

        No. This is because the local storage service is exclusive to each browser.
        Local storages cannot be shared amongst different browsers, hence reader.html does not have access to 
        content stored in the local storage by writer.html.
